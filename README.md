# Conformation_predict
Development of a ML model to predict conformation of secondary structure polypeptides using CD spectra and sequence.
Tensorflow and Keras are used as APIs along with the cuda toolkit.

PDB data collected from RCSB and BioPython and MDTraj were used to collect conformation/sequence info.
